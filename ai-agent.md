### Key Components Architecture

#### 1. Authentication Flow
```javascript
// Authentication stack
- LoginScreen
- RegistrationScreen
- ForgotPasswordScreen
- BiometricSetupScreen
```

#### 2. Main App Flow
```javascript
// Main tab navigator
- DashboardScreen
- AccountsScreen
- TransferScreen
- HistoryScreen
- SettingsScreen
```

#### 3. State Management Structure
```javascript
// Redux store structure
{
  auth: {
    user: {},
    isAuthenticated: boolean,
    biometricEnabled: boolean
  },
  accounts: {
    list: [],
    selectedAccount: {},
    balances: {}
  },
  transactions: {
    history: [],
    pending: [],
    contacts: []
  },
  ui: {
    loading: boolean,
    errors: []
  }
}
```

## API Integration Guidelines

### Mock API Structure
Since this is a demonstration app, implement mock APIs with the following endpoints:

```javascript
// Authentication
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/logout

// Accounts
GET /accounts
GET /accounts/{id}
GET /accounts/{id}/balance

// Transactions
GET /transactions
POST /transactions/transfer
GET /transactions/history

// Contacts
GET /contacts
POST /contacts
```

### Error Handling Strategy
